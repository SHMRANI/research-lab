## The Problem

Profits are being lost. The system finds good entries, but exits leave money on the table. This is the final obstacle before launch.

## The Data

**Trades**: Real executions with entry/exit points
**Market Data**: Complete price history for every traded stock

One position per stock. No overlapping trades. Clean data.

## The Solution Space

With the historical stock data and trade records, you can build any analysis:

- Plot charts with trade markers
- Compare against S&P 500 timing
- Calculate any indicator
- Analyze volume patterns
- Test take-profit strategies
- Measure what worked and what didn't

No missing data. No limitations. Everything needed is here.

## Reference Implementation

`trade_analyzer.py` shows one way to analyze trades.

**Recommended**: Use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to understand the code and build modifications.
